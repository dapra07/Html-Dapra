    <h1>From its medieval origins to the digital era, 
        learn everything 
        there is to know about 
        the ubiquitous lorem ipsum passage.</h1><hr><br>
<h4><u>HISTORY, PURPOSE AND USAGE</u></h4>
<p>
    Lorem ipsum, or lipsum as it is sometimes known, is dummy text used in,
    laying out print, graphic or web designs. The passage is attributed to an
    unknown typesetter in the 15th century who is thought to have scrambled
    parts of Cicero's De Finibus Bonorum et Malorum for use in a type
    specimen book. It usually begins with:
<ul type="circle">
    <li>    <i>“Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod
            tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.” </i>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
    The purpose of lorem ipsum is to create a natural looking block of text
    (sentence, paragraph, page, etc.) that doesn't distract from the layout. A
    practice not without <u>controversy,</u> laying out pages with meaningless filler
    text can be very useful when the focus is meant to be on design, not 
    content.
</p>
<h2>Some claim lorem ipsum
    threatens to promote design over
    content, while others defend its
    value in the process of planning.
</h2>
<h4>DESIGN OR (DIS)CONTENT</h4>
<p>
    Among design professionals, there's a bit of controversy surrounding the<br>
    filler text. Controversy, as in Death to Lorem Ipsum.<br>

<ol type="1">
<li>The strength of lorem ipsum is its weakness: it doesn't communicate. To
        some, designing a website around placeholder text is unacceptable, akin to
        sewing a custom suit without taking measurements. Kristina Halvorson
        notes:
    <ul><br>
        <li>
            <i> “I've heard the argument that “lorem ipsum” is effective in wireframing
                or design because it helps people focus on the actual layout, or color
                scheme, or whatever. What kills me here is that we're talking about
                creating a user experience that will (whether we like it or not) be
                <b>DRIVEN</b> by words. The entire structure of the page or app flow is FOR
                <strong>THE WORDS</strong>.”
            </i>
        </li>
    </ul>
</li>
    <br>

<li>Lorem ipsum is so ubiquitous because it is so versatile. Select how many
        paragraphs you want, copy, paste, and break the lines wherever it is
        convenient. Real copy doesn't work that way.<br>
        <strong>As front-end developer Kyle Fiedler put it:</strong>
        <br>
    <ul>
            <li> 
                <i>    
                        “When you are designing with Lorem Ipsum, you diminish the
                        importance of the copy by lowering it to the same level as any other
                        visual element. The text simply becomes another supporting role,
                        serving to make other aspects more aesthetic. Instead of your design
                        enhancing the meaning of the content, your content is enhancing your
                        design.”
                </i>
            </li> 
    </ul>
</li>
<br>
<li>    But despite zealous cries for the demise of lorem ipsum, others, such as
        <a href="https://www.facebook.com/share/r/QSGKE8u9jD5ngg8w/?mibextid=oFDknk"><u>Karen McGrane</u></a> offer appeals for moderation:
        
        <ul><br>
            <li>
                <i>
                    “Lorem Ipsum doesn't exist because people think the content is
                    meaningless window dressing, only there to be decorated by designers
                    who can't be bothered to read. Lorem Ipsum exists because words are
                    powerful. If you fill up your page with draft copy about your client's
                    business, they will read it. They will comment on it. They will be
                    inexorably drawn to it. Presented the wrong way, draft copy can send
                    your design review off the rails.”
                </i>
            </li>
        </ul>
</li>
    <br>

<li>

    And that's why a <b>15th century</b> typesetter might have scrambled a passage
    of Cicero; he wanted people to focus on his fonts, to imagine their own
    content on the pages. He wanted people to see, and to get them to see he
    had to keep them from reading.
